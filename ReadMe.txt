Hopper is a Java program. As such it should run on all personal computers provided that a Java Run-time Environment (JRE) version 6 or later has also been installed. If not, get a JRE from www.java.com
The files provided in Hopper.zip are:
- ReadMe.txt = this file
- Hopper.bat = batch file for running the application under Windows
- Hopper.sh = shell script for running the application in other systems (Linux, MacOS, Solaris, etc)
- Hopper.jar = all code and resources for the running application
All you have to do is unzip the file into any directory and (Windows) double-click Hopper.bat or (other systems) launch Hopper.sh
